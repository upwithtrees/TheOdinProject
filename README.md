The Odin Project

2/8/2024
I first began The Odin Project in 2022, I was also beginning to take classes for the Council of Law Enforcment of Oklahoma
to become a Private Investigator and taking an ethical hacking course. I took on way too much and overwhelmed myself and
began to focus on the CLEET schooling I had paid for Initially. After graduation I successfully got a job with the 
National Weather Center for an overnight security post. As I am writing this I have been working here since July 2023,
and it is currently February 2024. I have made my way back into taking the Web Developement classes with The Odin Project
and I restarted from the very begginning. This repository is EVERYTHING from 2024 onward. I deleted all my previous work
and decided the best way to get back was to start over from scratch. As much as I enjoy my position with the National
Weather Center, I have a passion for design and web developement. Ethical hacking and cyber security may be something 
I evaluate in the future, as well as the possible ML and AI developement. But as of today, 2/8/2024 My focus has shifted
STRICTLY into learning to code and starting from the basics. I want to understand my computer and what I am doing, 
I also dont want to jump into some bootcamp for a quick job. I want to create wonderful things. If you stumbled upon
this README, Thank you. If this is just something I look back onto as my future self, Thank you self, I hope you are
doing well.
