    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>CLICK ME</b></a>

        <!-- The target=_blank makes the link open in a new tab. The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the
        web page from which it was opened. Similarly the noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource
        has a link (or reference) to it. This is for security purposes, preventing phising attacks. It is reccommended to ALWAYS pair 
        target=_blank with the ref=noopener noreferrer  -->

        <!-- the above href link is an absolute link -->
